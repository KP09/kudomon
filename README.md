# Kudomon GO!
Credit Kudos' Technical Challenge.

## How to play?
Start the game by running `ruby lib/app.rb`

You will be able to move around a virtual 2D grid. When there are Kudomon nearby you can catch them, but you can only have one of each Kudomon species with you. Each Kudomon has a set number of health points (HP) and combat points (CP). You can check out your Kudomon squad at any point. When there are other trainers nearby you can challenge one to a battle. You get to choose which of your Kudomon you want to send into battle, and your opponent's Kudomon will be randomly selected.

If you want to change any of the game's settings, you can do so in `lib/config.rb`
